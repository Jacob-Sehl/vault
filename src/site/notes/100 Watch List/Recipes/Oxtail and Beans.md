# Oxtail and Beans    
## Ingredients

| Amount        | Ingredient    | Description    |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |

## Instructions

2 lb (1 kg) oxtail, jointed 1 clove garlic, chopped
Y4 cup (2 fl.oz, 50 ml) oil 1 sprig thyme
5 cups (2 pints, 1.25 litres) water 3 slices hot pepper
2 tomatoes, chopped salt and black pepper
2 onions, chopped % |b (250 g) cooked broad beans
Wash and dry the pieces of oxtail and brown them in the oil. Add
4 cups (1/4 pints, 1 litre) of water, bring to the boil, then lower the
heat and simmer until the oxtail is tender, adding more water if
necessary. Reduce the sauce to a thick gravy by increasing the
heat, then add the tomatoes, onions, garlic, thyme, hot pepper, |
salt and black pepper. Stir for a few minutes, then add the
remaining water and the broad beans. Mix them in, lower the
heat, cover again, and simmer for 10 minutes or until the water
evaporates leaving a thick gravy. Serve with rice. Enough for 4.
Another way of preparing the oxtail is to boil it until tender,
and then add the seasonings. Excess liquid is removed by rapid
boiling. This second method of preparation gives a less thick, rich
sauce, but is perhaps less fattening.
