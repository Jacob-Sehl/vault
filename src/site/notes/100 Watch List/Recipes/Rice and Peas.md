## Instructions

If you are doubtful about the age of your beans, soak them
overnight. To make coconut milk, add the water to the grated
coconut, mix well, squeeze the coconut with your hands to extract
as much milk as possible, and press through a sieve. Alternatively,
add the packet of coconut cream to the water.

Clean the beans of any grit and wash them. Put them in a
medium-sized pan which has a tight fitting lid. Add the coconut
milk and the salt beef or pig’s tail. Bring to the boil, then lower the
heat and cook until the beans are tender — the time will vary
according to their age, but they should be cooked in 1-2 hours if
they are dried, less if they are fresh. Add the thyme, hot pepper,
garlic, escallion and black pepper, and salt only if this is needed.
(The mixture should be quite salty at this stage.) Simmer for a few
minutes, then add the rice, which should be washed just before it is
added. 

The liquid now should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the rice, so add water if necessary. Cover the pot, bring to the boil once again, then immediately turn the heat to low. The rice will be ready as soon as the liquid disappears and each grain of rice is separate. Just before serving, stir to ensure even distribution of the beans. Enough for 6. Rice and peas made with green gungo peas is prepared in the same way, and heralds the Christmas and New Year season.
