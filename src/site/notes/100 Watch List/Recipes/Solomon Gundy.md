## Instructions

Place the shad, herring and mackerel in a large bowl. Cover them
with cold water and leave to soak for at least 4 hours to get rid of
the excess salt. Discard this water and add enough boiling water
to cover the fish completely. Leave for 5 minutes, then again
discard the water.
Remove the skin and heads from the fish, and as many of the
bones as possible. Either put the flesh of the fish through a food
mill with the onions and hot peppers, or chop the fish, onions and
peppers very finely. Mix very well. Add the oil, the whole pimento
berries and enough vinegar to make a paste. Store in sterilized jars.
It will keep indefinitely. Serve on crackers or thin slices of bread.
If shad is unavailable, use increased quantities of the other fish.
