| 2 lb (1 kg)     | smoked red herring |             |
| 1               | onion              | chopped     |

## Instructions

First remove the skin from the fish. To do this, wrap the fish
loosely with some newspaper and set it alight, allowing the paper
to burn on both sides. The skin will now come off easily. Discard
the head, remove all the bones, and shred the fish into small pieces.
Place in a bowl and add the chopped onion, vinegar, hot peppers
and pimento. Mix well and bottle. It will keep indefinitely. Serve
with crackers or thin squares of bread.
