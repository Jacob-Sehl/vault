# Codfish Balls    

## Ingredients

| Amount        | Ingredient    | Description    |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 6             | potatoes      |                |
| 1             | scotch bonnet | finely chopped |
| 1/2 lb (250g) | salt cod      |                |
| 1             | egg           | beaten         |
| 1 tbs         | butter        |                |
|               | oil           |                |
## Instructions

Peel the potatoes and boil them in water with the salt cod until the
potatoes are tender. Drain. Remove the skin and bones from the
fish and shred it, then pound it in a mortar until it is fine in texture.
Mash the potatoes and add the butter, hot pepper, pounded fish
and beaten egg. The mixture should be firm enough to mould into
little balls â€” add a little flour if it is not holding together. Fry the
fish balls in hot oil and drain them on kitchen paper. Serve hot.
