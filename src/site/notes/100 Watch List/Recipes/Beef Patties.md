## Instructions

The French émigrés from Haiti who arrived during the eighteenth
century are said to have brought with them the recipe for what has
become a national favourite — patties. For a long time these have
been the midday meal for many Jamaicans. Patties have a very
short life and are at their best eaten straight from the oven. I can
assure you that after eating these, you will not be tempted to buy
the commercially baked product.
Pastry 1 teaspoon salt
4 cups (11% lb, 600 g) flour 1 cup (8 0z, 250 g) shortening or
1 tablespoon curry powder (see margarine
p. 28) or turmeric iced water
Sieve together the flour, curry powder and salt. Work in the
shortening or margarine, adding enough iced water to hold the
dough together. Wrap it in foil and refrigerate for 12 hours or
overnight. Remove the dough 15 minutes before it is to be used.
Pull off just enough to make one patty at a time. Roll each piece
out and cut into circles approximately 4 inches (10 cm) across
(use a saucer for measurement). Sprinkle some flour on each and
stack, keeping them fresh by covering them with a damp cloth.
Filling 1 lb (500 g) breadcrumbs
2 onions 1 teaspoon thyme leaves
3 stalks escallion 2 tablespoons curry powder (see
2 hot peppers, Scotch bonnets if p. 28)
possible, seeds removed salt
2 |b (1 kg) minced beef black pepper
Ys cup (3 floz, 75 ml) oil 1 cup (8 fl oz, 250 ml) water
Put the onions, escallion and hot peppers through a mincer or
chop very finely by hand. Add to the beef and mix very well.
Heat the oil in a frying pan, throw in the meat mixture and stir for
about 10 minutes, then add the breadcrumbs, thyme and curry
powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well, then add the
water. Cover and simmer the mixture for 30 minutes. It should be
moist, neither runny nor dry. Leave to cool.
Place enough filling on each circle of pastry to cover half of it,
fold the other half over, and seal the edges by crimping them with

brown. Makes approximately 24.
