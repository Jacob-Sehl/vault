|        | Plantain or Bananas | green            |

## Instructions

Use green bananas and plantains. Remove the skins, slice into thin
rounds and place in some salted water for 10-15 minutes. Dry
them thoroughly. Fry the chips in lots of clean hot oil until they are
crisp. Drain on absorbent paper, sprinkle with salt, and store in
airtight jars. They make excellent accompaniments for dips.
