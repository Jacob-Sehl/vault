## Ingredients

| Amount         | Ingredient    | Description |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 2 dozen        | ackees        | in pods     |
| 1/2 lb (250g)  | salt cod      |             |
| 2 tbs          | butter        |             |
| 1/4 cup (50ml) | oil           |             |
| 2              | onions        | sliced      |
| 1 sprig        | thyme         |             |
| 3-4 slices     | scotch bonnet |             |
| 1 small        | tomato        | chopped     |
|                | black pepper  | to taste            |

## Instructions

Choose ackees that are completely open, with the black seed and
yellow fruit clearly visible in the scarlet pod. This is important, as
unripe ackees contain a highly toxic substance.

Remove the ackees from the pods. Discard the seeds and the
pink membrane found in the cleft of each fruit. Wash them and
put them to boil in:a large pot of water with the salt fish. (My
mother used to tie them in a muslin bag and drop the bag into the
water with the fish. This prevents the ackees from disintegrating.)
As soon as the ackees are tender, pour the contents of the pot into
a large sieve, discarding the water. Separate the ackees from the
fish. Run some cold water over the fish so that you can remove the
bones and skin comfortably, then flake it and set it aside.
Put the butter and oil to heat in a frying pan. Add the onions,
thyme and hot pepper slices, and the tomato if desired. Stir for a
few minutes then add the flaked fish. Stir for a few more minutes
then add the drained ackees, carefully stirring so as not to crush
them — this is a matter of taste, as some people do not like the
ackees crushed. Add a little more oil if necessary, sprinkle with
plenty of freshly ground black pepper, and the dish is ready.
Serve it decorated with halved hard-boiled eggs. If the dish is a
main course, avocado pear slices, fried plantains, bammies, yams,
dumplings and roasted breadfruit all make fine accompaniments.
Serves 4.

Ackee and saltfish also makes a very good starter when served with thin slices of avocado, or as ackee pie: line a pie tin with pastry (see p. 153), fill it with ackee and saltfish, sprinkle with cheese, and bake for 45 minutes at 400°F, 200°C, gas 6. Serve hot.
